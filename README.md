# Result-Analyzer
Result Analyzer was my practical project for the class 12th practical exams (2020).

### Some Background
The idea came to my mind as board exams were approaching.
Back then, our teachers only used to analyze the board results using MS Excel.

I thought how do they perform every single calculation of each type through excel!
That must be tyring and time consuming, so why not code it in python once and for all!

### Action Time!
So i decided to make my practical project as the result-analyzer and used my newly learned skills in python to achieve the code.
I was fairly new, so most of the code is just plain coding without using any external library/modules.

I asked my teacher for the sample result.txt file for the 2019 batch and he was happy enough to help me with the project, i studied the pattern of the text to extract the data and perform needed calculations.

### Note-
For security purposes, i won't be uploading the result.txt file and the final analysis.txt file of the 2019 board exams of our school here on GitHub yet.
